During my academic career, I had the opportunity to give many different lectures and courses. 
I gave courses at Graz University of Technology, FH Campus 02, University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, and University College of Teacher Education Styria.

I am especially proud that the courses *Introduction to Programming* and *Object-oriented Programming 1* were nominated (and short-listed) twice for the [**Excellence in Teaching Award**](https://www.tugraz.at/studium/lehre-an-der-tu-graz/strategie-lehre-und-lernen/preis-fuer-exzellente-lehre) from TU Graz. 
In 2022/23 the course *Object-oriented Programming 1* was finally **awarded** with the [prize](https://www.tugraz.at/tu-graz/services/news-stories/tu-graz-news/einzelansicht/article/tu-graz-praemiert-herausragende-wissensvermittlung). We presented our teaching concept for the course in a [poster](https://steinmaurer.cc/awards/2022-pfel.pdf).

## Courses
- **Introduction to Computing** \[WS 2024\] - This course is a newly developed concept for interdisciplinary Ph.D. students to teach the fundamentals of computational thinking, programming (Python programming language), operating systems, web technologies, data analytics, and the basics of machine learning.
- **Introduction to Programming** \[WS 2020-2024\]  - This course is offered as a first-semester course (winter semester) at TU Graz and is an introduction to programming using the C programming language. Around 800 students from different study programs participate each year in this lecture and practical lab. \[[Course website](https://coding.tugraz.at/), [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codingtugraz)\]
- **Object-oriented Programming 1**  \[SS 2021-2024\] - This follow-up course on *Introduction to Programming* is a second-semester course where students learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming using C++.  \[[Course website](https://coding.tugraz.at/), [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codingtugraz)\]
- **Project Management** \[SS 2021-2024\] - This is a mandatory course in the Bachelor's program of software engineering and management at Graz University of Technology. Students learn about the fundamentals of project management when working on an actual project in teams of four.  \[[YT playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQgwLycf7xY&list=PLtrp6_jkyyuI9P3YqBdLyskZjzquqqyQ4)\]
- **Introduction to Scientific Working** [2021-2024] - This course is mandatory for TU Graz students who want to write their Bachelor's thesis. It is held each semester.  \[[Course website](https://xstone93.github.io/sci-work), [YT playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIbp18fU5Ww&list=PLtrp6_jkyyuK49OmNlSEkQxmyov4K1HGc)\]
- **Engaging Learning Technologies** \[WS 2020-2024\] - In this interdisciplinary elective course, students learn about developing learning technologies and educational scenarios while evaluating their projects in real school classes.
- **Development of Multimedia Systems** (previously Multimedia Systems 2) \[SS 2021-2024\] - This seminar is part of the Master's program *Media Informatics and Digital Media Education* at the University College of Teacher Education Styria. It covers different topics related to multimedia systems, such as educational system design, game-based learning, evaluation, and web development.  \[[Course resources '23](https://xstone93.github.io/courses/MIM2_23.html)\]
- **Markup Languages** \[SS 2021-2022\] - This four-semester course is part of the Business Software Development program of FH Campus 02 (University of Applied Sciences). It covers the fundamentals of markup languages (HTML, XML, XSD, XPath) but also covers microservices and interface design (REST, JSON).
- **Operating Systems**  \[WS 2020-2021\] - This first-semester course at the Business Data Science program of FH Campus 02 covers the basics of operating systems. The students worked on concepts such as process management, memory management, I/O devices, Bash programming, and computer architecture.
