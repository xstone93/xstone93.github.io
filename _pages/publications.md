# Publications

I maintain my publications within a Google Docs [publication list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tQNeT14SvJLDQMYDtfQeuHtdW_vwFraIA8bpwHQnCPM/edit?usp=sharing)

Before that, I used [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander-Steinmaurer-3) for a while to manage all my publications. 
But as with almost every social network, it requires quite active maintenance, which takes some time. 
Even though RG has some good functionality to support you as much as possible, I ended up using mainly [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=vERJIRAAAAAJ) instead. 
There you can find all my (recent) papers.
